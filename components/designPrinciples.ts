export const BANNER_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES = `
- **Rule 1 (Maximize Readability):** The primary goal is legibility from a distance. All text elements, especially the main headline, must be large and clear.
- **Rule 2 (High Contrast):** Use a high-contrast color scheme. Text color should stand out sharply against the background. A simple, bold color palette works best.
- **Rule 3 (Strong Text Effects):** Every major text layer should have a strong stroke (외곽선) or a heavy drop shadow (그림자) to ensure readability against a complex background or in varied lighting.
- **Rule 4 (Impactful Imagery):** Use a single, high-quality photograph or graphic that captures the core message. The image should be dynamic and draw attention but not overpower the text.
- **Rule 5 (Simple, Bold Layout):** Keep the layout clean and uncluttered. Use large color blocks or simple graphic elements to create energy and guide the viewer's eye.

export const BUSINESS_CARD_FRONT_PRINCIPLES = `
- **Rule 1 (Clear Hierarchy):** The most important information (usually the company/person's name and logo) must be the most prominent. Establish a clear visual flow.
- **Rule 2 (Dynamic & Professional Layout):** Avoid overly static, centered layouts. Use principles of alignment, proximity, and white space to create a balanced and professional design.
- **Rule 3 (Brand Consistency):** The design must reflect the brand's identity. Use the brand's official colors, fonts, and logo consistently.
- **Rule 4 (Readability First):** Choose clean, legible fonts. Ensure there's enough contrast between text and background. Don't make the font size too small.
- **Rule 5 (Memorable Element):** Include one unique visual element to make the card memorable, whether it's a bold color, a unique layout, a tactile finish, or a clever use of the logo.

export const BUSINESS_CARD_BACK_PRINCIPLES = `
- **Rule 1 (Clarity and Function):** The back side is for detailed information. Prioritize readability and clear organization. Use ample white space to avoid a cluttered look.
- **Rule 2 (Structured Information):** Logically group information into sections: Contact Details (phone, email, website), Address, Social Media, and perhaps a short tagline or list of services.
- **Rule 3 (Maintain Branding):** Continue the visual identity from the front. Use brand colors for headings or icons, and include a smaller version of the logo if appropriate.
- **Rule 4 (Call to Action):** Make it easy for the recipient to act. List contact information clearly. A QR code linking to a website, portfolio, or social media profile is highly effective.
- **Rule 5 (Professional Typography):** Use a highly readable sans-serif font for body text. Create a clear hierarchy with font sizes and weights (e.g., bold for headings, regular for details).
